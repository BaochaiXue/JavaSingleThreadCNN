# JavaSingleThreadCNN
## Introduction
This is a simple CNN implementation in Java. It is a single thread version, which means it is not parallelized. The purpose of this project is to help people understand how CNN works. The code is simple and easy to understand. It is not optimized for performance. The code is written in Java purely. No other libraries are used. The code is tested on MNIST dataset. The accuracy is about 93% in test case.
